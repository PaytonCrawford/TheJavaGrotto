## Steps

 - To start developing off of this project, you would typically start by making a pull request from either the "development", "master" or "main" branches from this repository that have all of the up to date code and elements in them.
 
  - Next, open Android Studio and import the project you have just pulled from GitHub. Now, using GitBash (Or any equivilent), git checkout into development if you are not in that branch by default.
  
  - Create a branch off of development in the project folder in which you will be working and make sure to name the branch to clearly explain what you are working on (ex. viewpager, recyclerview, api, contact etc...).
  
  - Once work has been completed in the branch, push that branch up onto GitHub and then merge your branch into development locally and push the development branch as well. This will ensure that all completed work is now availabe on GitHub to other project collaborators.
